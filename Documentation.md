# Trade Simulator: High-Performance Market Impact Estimator

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed overview of the Trade Simulator application. The application is designed to estimate transaction costs and market impact of cryptocurrency trades in real-time, by connecting to WebSocket endpoints that stream full L2 orderbook data from cryptocurrency exchanges.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

### Components

1. **WebSocket Client**: Connects to the exchange WebSocket endpoint and receives real-time L2 orderbook data.
2. **Orderbook Processor**: Processes incoming orderbook data and maintains an up-to-date state of the orderbook.
3. **Trade Simulator**: Core component that integrates all models and provides simulation results.
4. **Models**:
   - **Slippage Model**: Estimates slippage using linear or quantile regression.
   - **Fee Model**: Calculates fees based on exchange fee structures.
   - **Almgren-Chriss Model**: Estimates market impact.
   - **Maker/Taker Model**: Predicts maker/taker proportion using logistic regression.
5. **Flask + SocketIO Server**: Provides API endpoints and pushes real-time updates to the frontend.
6. **Frontend**: Interactive UI for inputting parameters and viewing simulation results.

## Implementation Details

### Models

#### Slippage Model

- Implements both linear and quantile regression to predict slippage.
- Maintains a history of slippage observations for model training.
- When insufficient data is available (e.g., during startup), uses a heuristic model based on order size, spread, and market conditions.
- Features used for prediction:
  - Order size (USD)
  - Relative size (compared to available liquidity)
  - Spread (basis points)
  - Volatility
  - Orderbook imbalance

#### Fee Model

- Calculates trading fees based on exchange fee structures.
- Supports different fee tiers and maker/taker fee types.
- Calculates effective fee rate based on the predicted maker/taker proportion.

#### Almgren-Chriss Market Impact Model

- Implements the Almgren-Chriss model for estimating price impact.
- Consists of two components:
  1. Temporary impact: immediate price impact during execution
  2. Permanent impact: lasting price impact after execution
- Enhanced with orderbook imbalance information to adjust impact estimates.
- Parameterized by:
  - Market impact factor
  - Volatility factor
  - Risk aversion

#### Maker/Taker Proportion Model

- Uses logistic regression to predict the maker/taker proportion.
- Accounts for order size, market conditions, and orderbook state.
- When insufficient data is available, uses a heuristic model.

### Core Services

#### Orderbook Processor

- Maintains an up-to-date state of the orderbook.
- Provides efficient data structures for fast access and updates.
- Calculates important orderbook metrics:
  - Best ask/bid prices and quantities
  - Mid price and spread
  - Orderbook imbalance
  - Volume-weighted average prices for different order sizes

#### WebSocket Client

- Manages the WebSocket connection to the exchange.
- Handles connection establishment, message processing, and error recovery.
- Includes automatic reconnection with exponential backoff.
- Measures and reports performance metrics.

#### Trade Simulator

- Integrates all components to provide comprehensive simulation results.
- Manages simulation parameters and state.
- Processes incoming orderbook data.
- Calculates all output parameters:
  - Expected slippage
  - Expected fees
  - Expected market impact
  - Net cost
  - Maker/taker proportion
  - Internal latency

### Performance Optimization

The system is designed for high performance:

1. **Efficient Data Structures**: The orderbook implementation uses optimized data structures to minimize memory usage and maximize access speed.
2. **Caching**: Key calculations are cached with appropriate TTLs to avoid redundant computation.
3. **Batch Processing**: Updates are processed in batches to reduce computational overhead.
4. **Asynchronous Communication**: WebSocket and SocketIO are used for asynchronous, event-driven communication.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive benchmarking is implemented to measure and optimize performance.
